<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Get the flag and reach the exit. Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map 
and see what you can find! The game is available to download here. There is no source 
available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map. You can connect with it using 
nc saturn.picoctf.net (Your instance port).</p>

<h1>Approach</h1>
<p>First thing I did after connecting to the game over NC was to try random commands</p>
<h5>"Found" Commands</h5>
<ul>
  <li> 'w','a','s','d': Moves you player around the map</li>
  <li> 'p': Instantly moves your player to the "win" position</li>
  <li> 'l(placeholder)': Changes your character to the char placed after l [in placeholder position]</li>
  </ul>
 <p>I realized that you could escape out of the map by going to point (0,0). As I continued to travel outside the map I realized that 3-4 steps left from (0,0) updates the "Flags" register. When I saw that the register had "64" I pressed P and the flag was printed.</p>
